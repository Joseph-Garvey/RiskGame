# RiskGame
A homemade WPF version of the Risk Board Game.
Currently /very/ broken but updated every day.
Aiming to be finished before 24th June.
# Note on current patch
The current patch has implemented a UI overhaul for the login/registration screen. The backend has not been reconnected and thus the previous commit should be cloned if testing the game.
